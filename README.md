This script uses xsetwacom to manually calibrate a drawing tablet's pen and screen area, and also sets the button mapping.

_NOTE: This has only been tested on a Huion GT-156HD V2, using Arch Linux and KDE X11; but it should work on any Linux system. It should also work on any tablet, but you will likely need to re-map the buttons._

### Requirements:

- `xsetwacom`

### Usage

Manually run the script, or set to start with your login scripts.

### Important calibration notes

- The `xsetwacom set "Tablet Monitor Pen stylus" Area 0 0 69000 39000` command is what calibrates the pen to the tablet screen area. It uses values relative to the screen's resolution/area. I couldn't find a sensible equation for a "sweet spot", so I just tinkered with these values until I got something fairly accurate (i.e., the mouse/cursor is consistently following the pen movement).
- Regarding `xsetwacom set "Tablet Monitor Pen stylus" MapToOutput HEAD-1` (which maps the pen to the screen you will draw on): generally the syntax is, `xsetwacom set "Device Name" MapToOutput "Monitor"` however this was not working for me when using the devices name. I discovered this was caused by Nvidia's proprietary driver and the solution is to instead use `HEAD-1` as the monitor name, per: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Graphics_tablet#Mapping_the_tablet_to_a_monitor

### Customizing / Mapping notes

The following apply to the Huion GT-156HD V2, so you'll unfortunately have to figure out your own mappings by pressing each button one-by-one. Creating a spreadsheet can help (what I did here). I've also included their corresponding commands in Krita.

### Handy commands

- List physical devices and their ids: `xsetwacom --list devices` e.g.,
    - Tablet Monitor Pad pad
    - Tablet Monitor Pen stylus				
    - Tablet Monitor Touch Strip pad				

- Print current mapping: `xsetwacom get [...]` e.g.,
    - `xsetwacom get "Tablet Monitor Pad pad" Button 1` will print, `key +e` (i.e., the 'e' key)
 
- Show display devices: `xrandr`

### Known issues

- The touch strip / slider doesn't appear to be woriking properly.
